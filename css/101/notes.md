## general overview 

**link tag** is required in the top of the stylesheet. It has two attributes it has an **href** attribute which points to another url where the file lives and then we have the **rel** tag attribute that says it is a stylesheet. That is the syntax.   

**Dev tools** let us inspect website. It tell us what we need to know about how website is built 

**Sources** is where you can view your stylesheet. If you go into/click  **page** you can view the **assets** that are building the page. You want to look for  the **static and under css we can find the file behind website** 

**Elements** are the elements that build website. The overall structure.  

The syntax for a style sheet it is essential that you have **curly braces** . Everything inside of the curly braces comprises of what we call the style rule. And inside of it we have multiple key value pairs. The colon separates the key(also known as property) on the left with the value on the right.  

Each style rule must be preceded by a **valid selector** 

The selector refers to a place in html  - the selector precedes curly braces . 

 To target class to style website we must go into the css stylesheet and target the class. **The class starts with a dot (.) .** The dot means class , so the dot in css corresponds to the class in html. **The ID( hash #) is mostly used for javascript purposes.** 

To select a class in the style css sheet the selector is targeted **vis class (dot .) and to select and ID the selector is targeted via (#).**

We can style multiple elements differently via **Class(dot .) and ID(hash #) attributes** ( ex. div id = root , id is an attribute and its value is root)

**Asterisk(*)** is the universal selector , this means that every single element will be targeted and given the given styles inside the curly braces. 

In css every line  must end of a **semi colon**
