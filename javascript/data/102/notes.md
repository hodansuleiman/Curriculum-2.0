## Primitive Data Types ( strings, booleans, numbers) 

Three simple data types 

### string
A string is defined with `'` or `"`
```
let location = `Atlanta, Georgia`;
```

### boolean
The value of a boolean is either `true` or `false`. In this example false is a boolean. It is convention to name a variable with “is” if it is a boolean. It implies that it either is or it isn’t it’s either or or so it’s either true or false.
```
const isNew = false;
``` 

### number
pretty straightforward but `number` cannout write really, really big numbers.
```
let age = 32;
```

When you hear the word data type pay attention to what kind of data am i dealing with? Am I dealing with string, boolean, or number? or one the other data types that you’ll be dealing with ( i.e.  string, number, boolean, undefined, null, object, symbol, bigint)
