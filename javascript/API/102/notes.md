**`asynce`/`await`**
The most recent way to implement a promise. It is fairly easy to read and reason about. 

**callback functions**
Before promises were a thing, we used callback functions to handle asynchronous code. Callback functions were a headache if we ever needed to call asynchronous logic sequentially. This was known as callback hell. 

**promise**
A promise returns a response but we cannot control or predict when this happen. In dev speak, we say that a function returns a promise when the function has asynchronous logic that other code depends upon before it can be executed.


**`Promise`**
A class made available by JavaScript. We use an instance of this class to wrap asynchronous code.
